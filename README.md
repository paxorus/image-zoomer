# dark-light

This repo is intended for casual projects that ran on longer than usual. Like a moribund hall of fame, or a showcase for the underdogs, whichever perspective you prefer.

## [Virus Game](http://paxorus.github.io/dark-light/virus-game/float.html)
Use arrow keys to navigate the blue virus and WASD to navigate the purple virus. To infect a cell, gain proximity and hit spacebar. While at least one cell is being infected, there is no need to hit spacebar again (since the object collision loop is already going). See what happens when a cell finally hits 0 health points.

The macrophage in the top-left does nothing. For a serious game I would use Unity and Blender.

## [Zoomify](http://paxorus.github.io/dark-light/zoomify/index.html)
Double-click to zoom into the 400x300 image or use the range to zoom without panning. A second set of 400x300 images will be loaded. Thus a collection of subimages of varying resolution can save loading time, the same technique used by Google Maps. The vector math was interesting. But for the [Enhancer Trap Line Browser](https://enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu/browser/) we ended up purchasing and using [Zoomify](http://www.zoomify.com/)'s scripts anyways.
