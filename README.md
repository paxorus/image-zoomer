Double-click to zoom into the 400x300 image or use the range to zoom without panning. A second set of 400x300 images will be loaded. Thus a collection of subimages of varying resolution can save loading time, the same technique used by Google Maps. The vector math was interesting. But for the [Enhancer Trap Line Browser](https://enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu/browser/) we ended up purchasing and using [Zoomify](http://www.zoomify.com/)'s scripts anyways.
